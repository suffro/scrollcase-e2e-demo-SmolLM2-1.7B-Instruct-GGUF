"""Local LLM entrypoint for the SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct GGUF box.

Reads its weights from inside the box payload, at the location the box's own
`box.json` declares. Nothing is downloaded at run time, no hub client is imported
and no API key exists: the box answers on the machine it is unpacked on.

The application prints exactly one thing to stdout -- the model's answer.
Everything else -- progress, timings, usage, failures -- goes to stderr, so the
answer can be piped into another program without filtering. The chat prompt is
part of "everything else": it is written to stderr too, which is what keeps
`entrypoint.py < questions.txt > answers.txt` producing a file of just answers.

Given words, it answers once and exits. Given nothing, it opens a chat that
holds the conversation across turns on a single load of the weights.
